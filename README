QuicklookStephen
================

QLStephen is a QuickLook plugin that lets you view plain text files without
a file extension. Files like:

README
INSTALL
CapFile
CHANGELOG
etc...

Install
=======

To install the plugin just copy the QLStephen.qlgenerator file into
the relevant QuickLook folder. If the folder is not present, then
you will need to create it first:

1. If just you want to use this plugin

  /Users/yourusername/Library/QuickLook/

2. If you want any user on this machine to use plugin

  /Library/QuickLook/


Restart
=======

I have found that in OSX Lion that I had to run:

    qlmanage -r

in order for the plugin to get seen
